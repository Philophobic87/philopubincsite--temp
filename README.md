# Philophobic Website Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a website prototype for my personal music publishing business, Philophobia Publishing, Inc. It is around 60% complete, below is a list of the (current) tentative fixes/upgrades still on the horizon:

# Navbar:

- Improve mobile navbar (hamburger menu) activation functionality (currently not precise)

# Hero Section:

- Compress/Minify jumbotron video for better performance

# Jump to section arrow button:

- Update button to jump to the next section
- Convert button functionality to return to top near bottom of page

# Playlist:

- Add songs to AWS server
- Add transport button functionality
- Add volume slider functionality

# Subscription Form:

- Add enail subscription form functionality

These changes will be continuously iterated upon and updates will be pushed to this repo as they are completed.
